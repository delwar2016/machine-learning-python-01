# machine-learning-python-01

## Steps of machine learning are as follows:

    1.  Define Problem.
    2.  Prepare Data.
    3.  Evaluate Algorithms.
    4.  Improve Results.
    5.  Present Results.
    
## 6 different algorithms:

    1.  Logistic Regression (LR)
    2.  Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
    3.  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
    4.  Classification and Regression Trees (CART).
    5.  Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB).
    6.  Support Vector Machines (SVM).
